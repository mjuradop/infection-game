# Infection Simulation Game

A simple grid-based infection simulation built in Python.  
This project is designed to practice coding, I always have liked strategy games so this is my first try to create one.

## Features
- 10x10 grid
- One infected cell at start
- Infection spreads randomly
- Console-based visualization

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
