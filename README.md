# Infection Simulation Game

A simple grid-based infection simulation built in Python.  
This project is designed to practice GitHub workflows, create incremental commits, and build a visual simulation.

## Features (v1)
- 10x10 grid
- One infected cell at the start
- Infection spreads randomly at each step
- Text-based visualization in console

## Future Improvements (ideas for commits)
- Add infection probability
- Add recovery states
- Add color-based console rendering
- Add matplotlib visualization
- Add interface to change grid size

## How to Run
```bash
python main.py
